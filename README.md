# Kanye test app

## Before you start

You should install dependencies at first. Depending on the package manager, these can be the following commands

`yarn` or `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build` or `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
And the app is ready to be deployed!
